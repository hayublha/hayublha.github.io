<h2>How they got their name?</h2>

<p>Tyler came up with the band's name while studying all my sons by Arthur Miller. Its a play about a man who must decide what is the best choice for his family after causing the death ofTwenty-one pilots during WWII. The man sent the pilots faulty parts for the good of his business. So they chose this name to basically bring the name back.</p>
